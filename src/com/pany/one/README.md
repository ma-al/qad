Problem
=======
You are given an array of numbers:
```json
[4,6,7,8,9,1,1,2,0,3,4,0,4,5,8,7,9]
```

Then you're given a smaller series of numbers
```json
[8,9,7]
```

Find all *sequential* permutations of the smaller set on the larger set.

So, using the above arrays, the function needs to return [7,8,9] and [8,7,9]
