Brief
=====
Attempted on 2016-11-24. I'm only giving myself 30 mins here, because I've been
thinking about this all day. (not the whole time... on and off :P)

Problem
=======
This is a continuation of the previous toy problem.

Given a series of numbers:
```json
[8,9,7]
```

Find all permutations of that sequence of numbers. For above, there should be:
```
789
798
879
897
978
987
```

Post-Mortem
===========
Failed miserable after 30 mins. Only got 2 out of 6 possible permutations. After
another 20 mins, still couldn't figure it. Gave up for a while. Then decided to
sketch it out on paper... and boom!
